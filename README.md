# Twitter-Receipts

Quick tool for getting old Twitter snapshots from the Wayback Machine

Sometimes public figures use Twitter like an amnesia machine - they'll tweet something outrageous, get pushback, delete it, and then pretend like we all have amnesia and never saw it. 

We don't have amnesia but neither do we have time to go look up their old saved tweets in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. That's what Twitter Receipts is for.

Twitter receipts uses the Wayback Machine API to get a cached version of a specified handle's Twitter account nearest to the date you specify. There's an API call but no key is required. HTML and script are on one page; you can put this on your Web site or just use it as a local file - I had no problem doing that when I tested it.
